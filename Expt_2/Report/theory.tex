\subsection{Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)}
The Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) is essentially a combination of two PN junction diodes.  According to the order in which the diodes are connected, we have npn and pnp transistors. The emitter region is much smaller than the collector and much more strongly doped while the base is very thing and very lightly doped. A large collector is needed since it should have more surface area for dissipating the power generated there.\\[0.3cm]

It is a three terminal device with the terminals named as emitter, base and collector but to act as an amplifier, we need four terminals. Hence, we make one terminal common. The most commonly studied configuration is the common emitter configuration where the emmiter is common to both input and output.\\[0.3cm]
A BJT works in three modes: Active, Saturation and Cutoff Modes, according to which junction is forward or reverse biased.
